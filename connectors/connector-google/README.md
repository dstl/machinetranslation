# Google Cloud Translate Connector

This connector allows you to use the [Google Cloud Translate](https://cloud.google.com/translate/) API to perform translation via the Machine Translation Connector API.

There is no configuration for this connector, but you will need to set up authentication with a Google Cloud account.
Instructions on how to do this can be found in the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication).
